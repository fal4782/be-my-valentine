# 🌹 Be My Valentine?

A delightful and interactive way to pop the Valentine's question! This adorable web app features:

## ✨ Special Features

- A charming proposal with style
- Playful "Yes" and "No" buttons (but the "No" button has a mind of its own! 😉)

- Happy cat dance celebration when they say yes!
- Festive confetti shower
- Sweet celebration music

## 💝 How It Works

When your special someone opens the app, they'll be greeted with a beautiful "Will you be my Valentine?" message. The fun begins when they try to interact with the buttons:

- The "No" button plays hard to get (literally!)
- Once they click "Yes", the celebration begins with music, confetti, and a dancing cat!
- Add their name to the URL (like `/Pookie`) for a personalized proposal!
